### About myself

***Job Objective:*** Since 2021 I am studying to become a media specialist, however I want to develop my skills in IT and find a job related to it in the future.

***Education:*** I studied all 11 years at school, then one year at a Russian university as a teacher of German. Now I study at a German university, I study media science and Korean studies.

***Strengths:*** My strengths are that I am a good language learner and therefore always ready to learn something new. It is not a problem for me to sit at some work for several hours, I will definitely do it. I am also a "team player". Working in a team is a pleasure for me.

***Skills:*** Knowledge of the Russian language (Native language), German (C1), English (B1), Korean (A2). There is also a constant practice of communicating with foreigners not only about everyday things, but also about professional ones.

***Code example:*** Example from Codewars:

Code was with the problem: 

`functional multiply (a, b) {a * b}` 

The correct code became:

`functional multiply (a, b) {return a * b}`
